 HUN_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Il-28"
 HUN_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "(Historical) In Hungary, small numbers were used from 1955 to 1966. The Hungarian bombers were probably the most peaceful bombers in the world because neither bombs, ammunition for gunshots, cameras for aerial reconnaissance were systematized.

 HUN_strat_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "He-111 P-2"
 HUN_strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "(Historical/Hypotethical) The long range reconnaissance aircraft were fitted for high altitude deployments after their withdrawal, increased their fuel capacity and were used as strategic bombers. After the transformations it was only able to transport a small amount of bombs at a great distance, and because of this, its combat value was not significant.
