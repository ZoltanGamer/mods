 HUN_worker_spirit:0 "Worker Spirit"

 HUN_german_revolution:0 "German Revolution"
 HUN_german_revolution_desc:0 "The greatest of our enemies, Germany is ready to jump at our throat. While taking a stand against them, and fighting them off would be a heroic feat indeed, we might just turn them to our side, if we play our cards right.

 HUN_minority_rights:0 "Minority Rights"
 HUN_minority_rights_desc:0 "We can't expect foreign ethinicities to assimilate in a matter of years, so the easiest way to integrate them, is to give them the same, (or almost the same) rights, as the rest of our citizens. This way they won't feel like they are foreigners in our country."

 HUN_hungarization:0 "Hungarization"
 HUN_hungarization_desc:0 "It is not enough, that the population of the integrated territories is not against us. We have to instill Hungarian ideals in them, and make them understand, that they have to fight for this country, if they are to live in it.

 HUN_revisionism:0 "Revisionism"

 HUN_conscription_reforms:0 "Conscription Reforms"
 HUN_conscription_reforms_desc:0 "Outright extending conscription might couse public outrage, but if we carefully juggle with laws, we might still acquire a bigger pool of manpower.

 HUN_revisionist_education:0 "Revisionist Education"
 HUN_revisionist_education_desc:0 "Our education system has to embrace the ideas of revisionism, and pass on the spirit to the younger generations.

We will use our influence to support Poland's claims in the region."
 HUN_invite_bulgaria:0 "Invite Bulgaria"
 HUN_invite_bulgaria_desc:0 "Bulgaria has served our cause in the Great War out of necessity more than friendship. Maybe they could do so again, if we strengthened our relationship with them a bit.

 HUN_burgas_industrial_development_project_desc:0 "The military nature of our alliance with Bulgaria might distance us from them, but that won't stop us from trying to build a genuine friendship between our countries.

 HUN_turkish_troop_exchange:0 "Turkish Troop Exchange"
 HUN_turkish_troop_exchange_desc:0 "Alliances are built on mutual trust. We could ensure this trust with Turkey, if our armies would perform an exchange of soldiers, giving both countries control of a small group of the other's soldiers.

 HUN_megali_idea:0 "Megali Idea"
 HUN_megali_idea_desc:0 "Ever since the Greeks declared their independence from the Ottomans, they have dreamt of unifying all ethnically, and historically Greek lands.

 HUN_trialism_desc:0 "During the years of the Great War, the idea of Trialism - turning the dual monarchy into a three-state monarchy, by adding Croatia - was brought up as a resolution to the growing tension between the nationalities of the empire.

 HUN_wilsons_10th_point_desc:0 "President Woodrow Wilson had a very different plan for the fate of Austria-Hungary, than what actually came to pass.

 HUN_the_rongyos_garda_desc:0 "After our defeat in the Great War, the Rongyos Gárda - a ragtag band of volunteer troops - has helped to secure the western borders of our small country, including Sopron, which would probably be an Austrian city, if it wasn't for them. They have again been a great help after the events of the First Vienna Award, in keeping the Slovaks occupied. We should provide them with government funding and support."
 HUN_military_land_survey:0 "Military Land Survey"
 HUN_military_land_survey_desc:0 "The country has recently grown, and if we want to keep our new territories, we have to be able to defend them.

 HUN_hungarian_ss_desc:0 "We could strike a deal with Germany, and let them conscript Hungarians, and Germans from Hungary into their Waffen SS, in return for some subsidies for our tank production.

 HUN_reinforce_the_regency:0 "Reinforce The Regency"
 HUN_reinforce_the_regency_desc:0 "Miklós Horthy wields most of the actual power in the country, but the parliment still operates independently of the regent. We must restore authority to the head of the state, and reassure his position as our nation's leader."

 HUN_reassert_old_claims:0 "Reassert Old Claims"
 HUN_reassert_old_claims_desc:0 "It is bad enough that the Allies have ignored the reasonable request of Albert Apponyi at the Treaty of Versailles, to limit the territorial losses of Hungary, since then, the world seems to have forgotten that our country was once one of the greatest in the region. The historical territory of the Kingdom of Hungary has to be restored, thus, we are openly announcing our claims on the lost provinces."

 HUN_claim_fiume_desc:0 "The port of Fiume was contested even in the times of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, but it has now come under the occupation of Italy.

 HUN_demand_slovakia:0 "Demand Slovakia"
 HUN_demand_slovakia_desc:0 "Slovakia - or Czechoslovakia for that matter - isn't and never was a viable country. It is merely a construct of Trianon, and as such, is not recognised by the new Hungarian government. Czechoslovakia will cede all territories in question, or we take it by force.

 HUN_yugoslavian_pact_of_everlasting_friendship_desc:0 "Even though Yugoslavia holds provinces that should be ours, they would make a great ally, if we were to oppose Germany.

 HUN_partition_yugoslavia:0 "Partition Yugoslavia"
 HUN_partition_yugoslavia_desc:0 "This monstrosity of a country called Yugoslavia is yet another ugly product of the peace treaties after the Great War.

 HUN_demand_transylvania:0 "Demand Transylvania"
 HUN_demand_transylvania_desc:0 "Transylvania, one of the oldest core parts of our country was wrongly assumed to be rightfully Romanian land, and shall be ceded to our glorious country immediately.

 HUN_threaten_war_for_banat:0 "Threaten War For Banat"
 HUN_threaten_war_for_banat_desc:0 "Although Banat is not primarily inhabited by Hungarians, it would be strategically beneficial to acquire it, as it makes our southern borders excessively long.

 HUN_the_arpad_line_desc:0 "At one point or another, we have to consider the possibility of a Soviet attack from the east. The red army has to be stopped right at our doorstep, the Carpathian mountains, otherwise they will quickly advance through our country. The terrain in Carpathian Ruthenia is perfectly fit for the construction of a strong defensive line, which shall be known as the 'Árpád Line', after the head of Hungarian tribes, Árpád."
 HUN_extend_the_arpad_line:0 "Extend The Árpád Line"
 HUN_extend_the_arpad_line_desc:0 "We are now well defended from the northeast, but the newly acquired region of Transylvania lies defenseless. The Árpád Line needs to be extended to the southeast, all the way through the Eastern Carpathians, if we hope to defend against the red army."

 HUN_artillery_factory_in_szeged_desc:0 "Artillery is an essential part of any division. Our country still lacks a proper line of production for the equipment used by artillery units, but a small arms factory in Szeged could be expanded to facilitate a new production line dedicated to artillery."
 HUN_budapest_ferihegy_airport:0 "Budapest Ferihegy Airport"

 HUN_fighter_production_innovations:0 "Fighter Production Innovations"
 HUN_fighter_production_innovations_desc:0 "Perhaps assigning our entire industry to the production of fighters is not the smartest way of going about creating the large air force we desire. If we could make some progress towards production innovations, we could build smarter, instead of harder."
 HUN_targeted_destruction_focus:0 "Targeted Destruction Focus"
 HUN_targeted_destruction_focus_desc:0 "With our current industrial capacity, we cannot hope to outmatch any of the major powers' air forces with fighters.
