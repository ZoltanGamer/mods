 hungary_flavor.49.t:0 "Austria declines Slovenian trade"
 hungary_flavor.49.d:0 "It may come as a surprise, but Austria refused to cede Burgenland in return for Slovenia. The territorial gains would certainly have outweighed the losses, and they would have regained a province that is traditionally theirs."

 hungary_flavor.53.t:0 "Györi Program: Phase III"
 hungary_flavor.53.d:0 "The third phase of the Györi Program is ready to be executed.

 hungary_flavor.53.a:0 "The skies will know the might of [Root.GetName]."
 
 hungary_flavor.54.t:0 "Györi Program: Phase IV"
 hungary_flavor.54.d:0 "The fourth, and final phase of the Györi Program focuses on the navy. Initially, the navy was not included in the plan, due to lack of any ports in the country. Some extra funds have enabled us to invest in naval development, and production."

 hungary_flavor.56.t:0 "Yugoslavia declines Everlasting Friendship"
 hungary_flavor.56.d:0 "Perhaps still feeling threatened by the possibility of revisionist claims from [Root.GetName], Yugoslavia has dismissed the idea of cooperation between our countries. Surely, this is not meant as an act of hostility, merely a sign of caution on their behalf."

 hungary_flavor.57.t:0 "Territorial settlement with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.57.d:0 "Though we have declared our friensdhip with Yugoslavia, there is still the question of our territorial disputes.

 hungary_flavor.57.a:0 "They will surely agree that Novi Sad is Hungarian."
 hungary_flavor.57.b:0 "We cannot risk the good relations with them for territorial gains."
 
 hungary_flavor.58.t:0 "Successful negotiations with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.58.d:0 "Yugoslavia has accepted our proposal, and handed over control of Novi Sad. They clearly take our friendship seriously, and rightly so. We will make right on our promises, and support their political efforts."
 hungary_flavor.58.a:0 "A fruit of the friendship between our countries."
 
 hungary_flavor.59.t:0 "Unsuccessful negotiations with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.59.d:0 "Yugoslavia has understandably refused to cede Novi Sad. We offered little in return, and their territorial integrity is backed by the Allies. The friendship between our countries might not yet come to an end, but everybody left the negotiating table with a sour taste in their mouths."
 hungary_flavor.59.a:0 "This is bound to hurt our relations with them."
 
 hungary_flavor.60.t:0 "Alliance with Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.60.d:0 "Yugoslavia has proven to be a willing partner in cooperation, and our political views align with theirs. To further strengthen our friendship, we should invite them into our faction, and guarantee to defend one another in conflicts to come."

 hungary_flavor.61.a:0 "A toast to our friendship!"
 
 hungary_flavor.62.t:0 "Yugoslavia declines alliance"
 hungary_flavor.62.d:0 "The negotiations about an alliance with Yugoslavia have been a failure. They outright rejected the proposal, not wanting to get involved in any of our political struggles. It would seem that they value their neutrality too much."

 hungary_flavor.63.t:0 "Funding for the Györi Program"
 hungary_flavor.63.d:0 "Some investors have approached the governmental coordinators, responsible for the execution of the Györi Program.

 hungary_flavor.64.t:0 "Italy accepts demands"
 hungary_flavor.64.d:0 "Italy made the sensible decision to accept the Greek territories in return for giving up the Austro-Hungarian ones. Maybe they only did it to keep the peace, maybe they misjudged the value of the provinces. Whichever the case, the deal is sealed."
 hungary_flavor.64.a:0 "Surprising, but welcome news."
 
 hungary_flavor.65.t:0 "Italy declines demands"
 hungary_flavor.65.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, Italy has refused to relinquish control over our former territory. The promise of Greek territories was not enough to convince them, and they fail to see the true strength of our nation. Our former territories remain in Italian hands."

 hungary_flavor.78.d:0 "As the war is turning more and more in the favor of our enemy, it might be time to plan our exit from the war. As Bismarck once said, 'No nation ought to sacrifice itself on the altar of an alliance'."
 hungary_flavor.78.a:0 "Negotiate a secret treaty with the Soviets."
 hungary_flavor.78.b:0 "We have to try to reach out to the Allies."
 hungary_flavor.78.c:0 "We will be forever loyal to the Axis."
 
 hungary_flavor.79.t:0 "Soviets support exit attempt"
 hungary_flavor.79.d:0 "The negotiations were successful. The Soviet Union has agreed to support our exit attempt, and promised to protect us, once we abandon Germany."
 hungary_flavor.79.a:0 "At least we might still be on the winning side."
 
 hungary_flavor.80.t:0 "Joining the Soviet Union"
 hungary_flavor.80.d:0 "Arrangements were made to withdraw all Hungarian forces from potential danger, and a Soviet-friendly government has been set up. Everything is set for our exit attempt, now we have to hope for the best and trust in our new allies to defend us against Germany."
 hungary_flavor.80.a:0 "We have made our choice."
 
 hungary_flavor.81.t:0 "Soviets rebuff exit attempt"
 hungary_flavor.81.d:0 "The Soviet Union refused to negotiate our exit, stating that they will not negotiate with the enemy."
 hungary_flavor.81.a:0 "We're stuck with the Germans then."
 
 hungary_flavor.82.t:0 "Allies support exit attempt"
 hungary_flavor.82.d:0 "The negotiations were successful. The Allies have agreed to support our exit attempt, and promised to protect us, once we abandon Germany."
 hungary_flavor.82.a:0 "At least we might still be on the winning side."
 
 hungary_flavor.83.t:0 "Joining the Allies"
 hungary_flavor.83.d:0 "Arrangements were made to withdraw all Hungarian forces from potential danger, and a temporary government has been set up. Everything is set for our exit attempt, now we have to hope for the best and trust in our new allies to defend us against Germany."
 hungary_flavor.83.a:0 "We have made our choice."
 
 hungary_flavor.84.t:0 "Allies rebuff exit attempt"

 hungary_flavor.84.a:0 "We're stuck with the Germans then."
 
 hungary_flavor.85.t:0 "The Arrow Cross Party"
 hungary_flavor.85.d:0 "An unexpected turn of events has caused great commotion in the country. German forces have crossed the border, and occupied key facilities, including administrative buildings in the capital. The previous government has been replaced with the fascist Arrow Cross Party, led by Ferenc Szálasi, which took control of the country immediately. This is most likely the German's way of saying they don't trust us to follow their lead."
 hungary_flavor.85.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 hungary_flavor.85.b:0 "Get ready to fight!"
 hungary_flavor.85.tt:0 "The Arrow Cross Party will become the ruling party, with Ferenc Szálasi as its head.\n"
 
 hungary_flavor.86.t:0 "Romania withdraws from Banat"
 hungary_flavor.86.d:0 "Our threat proved to be enough to scare the Romanians. All of their forces were withdrawn from the borders, leaving Banat free to be annexed by us."
 hungary_flavor.86.a:0 "The cowards flee, and the brave conquer."
 
 hungary_flavor.87.t:0 "Romania refuses to withdraw from Banat"
 hungary_flavor.87.d:0 "The threat was not enough to coerce Romania into ceding Banat. We can now declare war over the territory, or back down. Not declaring would make us seem weak internationally, as we have made explicit threats stating the opposite."
 hungary_flavor.87.a:0 "They will regret this."
 hungary_flavor.87.b:0 "We won't waste sweat and blood for such a small piece of land."
 
 hungary_flavor.88.t:0 "Turkey accepts alliance"
 hungary_flavor.88.d:0 "The agreement has been signed, Turkey is now officially a member of [Root.GetFactionName]. In the event of a war, the two countries will now stand, or fall together."
 hungary_flavor.88.a:0 "This is an important step in the right direction."
 
 hungary_flavor.89.t:0 "Turkey declines alliance"
 hungary_flavor.89.d:0 "Perhaps the new Turkish state has lost all of its pride, or desire for greatness, because they decided to stay out of our faction, and be left out of all the glory and rewards that would have come with it."
 hungary_flavor.89.a:0 "We are better off without them anyways."
 
 hungary_flavor.90.t:0 "Support for democratic elections in Hungary"
 hungary_flavor.90.d:0 "Liberal ideas have taken hold of the country, and support for democratic elections is on the rise. We better prepare for a change in government."
 hungary_flavor.90.a:0 "What a time to be alive."
 
 hungary_flavor.91.t:0 "Support for communism in Hungary"
 hungary_flavor.91.d:0 "Worker unions are organising protests and strikes countrywide, while the communist party is preparing to set up a new government. Either through elections, or a forceful rebellion, communism will eventually grab hold of the power in Hungary."
 hungary_flavor.91.a:0 "What a time to be alive."
 
 hungary_flavor.92.t:0 "Miklós Horthy: Regent, or King"
 hungary_flavor.92.d:0 "It is no secret, that our regent, Miklós Horthy, would like his son to succeed him, effectively starting a new ruling dynasty in Hungary. There is some support for crowning him King of Hungary, which would finally put an end to the regency, though some might see this as an undemocratic move. Will we support his claim to the throne?"
 hungary_flavor.92.a:0 "We will not assist in creating another dynasty."
 hungary_flavor.92.b:0 "Long live the King!"
 
 hungary_flavor.93.t:0 "Reinstatement of Miklós Horthy"
 hungary_flavor.93.d:0 "Miklós Horthy will be reinstated as commander of our new navy, the only question is what his role should be. Should he become an admiral again, or rather direct our naval effort from the back, as chief of navy?"
 hungary_flavor.93.a:0 "Horthy will become the chief of navy."
 hungary_flavor.93.b:0 "He will be reestabilished as an admiral."
 
 hungary_flavor.94.t:0 "Germany agrees to help"
 hungary_flavor.94.d:0 "Not only did Germany agree to sending a delegation to aid us, they also transferred two of their generals to lead our troops. This is a massive success, and an important milestone in the cooperation of our nations."
 hungary_flavor.94.d_2:0 "Germany agreed to send the delegation we asked for. Part of the General Staff will now be directing the military efforts of Hungary, and aiding our high command."
 hungary_flavor.94.a:0 "Wonderful news."
 hungary_flavor.94.b:0 "Wonderful news."
 hungary_flavor.94.tt:0 "Generals Erwin von Witzleben and Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb will report for duty."
 
 hungary_flavor.95.t:0 "Germany refuses to help"
 hungary_flavor.95.d:0 "For some strange reason, Germany declined our request for closer cooperation. We will have to rely on our own military staff to direct the coordination of the army."
 hungary_flavor.95.a:0 "This is disappointing, to say the least."
 
 hungary_flavor.96.t:0 "Turkish troop exchange"
 hungary_flavor.96.d:0 "Turkey agreed to the troop exchange program. We will shortly be greeting the brigades that they sent us, and our divisions are already on their way to Istanbul."
 hungary_flavor.96.a:0 "This will bring our nations even closer to one another."
 hungary_flavor.96.tt:0 "We will receive two infantry divisions from Turkey.\n"
 
 hungary_flavor.97.t:0 "Turkey declines troop exchange proposal"
 hungary_flavor.97.d:0 "The Turkish government rejected our offer of troop exchange, probably due to the risk they would be putting their soldiers in. Perhaps it is best that we both stick to our own armies."
 hungary_flavor.97.a:0 "They surely have their reasons."
 
 hungary_flavor.98.t:0 "Trianon restrictions invalidated"
 hungary_flavor.98.d:0 "As we are now part of an alliance, noone can enforce the restrictions set by the allies after the Great War anymore. Our friends will protect our right to arm ourselves."
 hungary_flavor.98.d_2:0 "The military restrictions set by the allies after the Great War are long forgotten, even by those who set them. In today's ever-changing political climate, such a restriction can not be enforced anymore. "
 hungary_flavor.98.a:0 "Together we are strong."
 hungary_flavor.98.b:0 "Were those restrictions still valid? I didn't notice."
 
 hungary_flavor.99.t:0 "Györi program goes against Trianon restrictions"
 hungary_flavor.99.d:0 "The armament program we started is openly violating the military restrictions set by the allies at Trianon. We are not supposed to research, or manufacture artillery, armored vehicles, and aircraft. We could try to keep to these boundaries, and still continue with the program, but it would slow our efforts noticeably."
 hungary_flavor.99.a:0 "We will openly disobey the constraints."
 hungary_flavor.99.b:0 "Perform the restricted research in secret."
 hungary_flavor.99.c:0 "Try our best to stay within the boundaries."
 hungary_flavor.99.tt:0 "The progress of the Györi Program will be slightly hindered."
 
 hungary_flavor.100.t:0 "The Visegrád Group"
 hungary_flavor.100.d_both:0 "Success! Both Czechoslovakia, and Poland have agreed to enter the Visegrád group. This is the beginning of a fruitful alliance."
 hungary_flavor.100.d_cze:0 "Only Czechoslovakia agreed to enter our alliance. Nevertheless, the faction will be formed, even if only with two founding members."
 hungary_flavor.100.d_pol:0 "Only Poland agreed to enter our alliance. Nevertheless, the faction will be formed, even if only with two founding members."
 hungary_flavor.100.d_neither:0 "Disaster! Neither Czechoslovakia, nor Poland entered the proposed alliance. We are left alone in our fight."
 hungary_flavor.100.a:0 "The Visegrád Triangle is strong."
 hungary_flavor.100.b:0 "We will build a strong alliance with Czechoslovakia."
 hungary_flavor.100.c:0 "At least our Polish friends are willing to join."
 hungary_flavor.100.e:0 "It seems this alliance died before it could be born."
 
 hungary_flavor.101.t:0 "Baltic expansion of the Visegrád Group"
 hungary_flavor.101.d_all:0 "The expansion has been a full-blown success! All three candidates have accepted the invitation. This is certainly cause for celebration."
 hungary_flavor.101.d_some:0 "The Baltic expansion has been a partial success. We could not convince all Baltic states to join, but the alliance expands nevertheless."
 hungary_flavor.101.d:0 "The Baltic expansion has been a partial success. We could not convince all Baltic states to join, but the alliance expands nevertheless."
 hungary_flavor.101.d_none:0 "The Baltic states have all rejected our request. It seems we must look elsewhere, if we still wish to expand the alliance."
 hungary_flavor.101.a:0 "Let us welcome the new members."
 hungary_flavor.101.b:0 "Let us welcome the new members."
 hungary_flavor.101.c:0 "A disappointing result."
 
 hungary_flavor.102.t:0 "Federalisation of Austria-Hungary"
 hungary_flavor.102.d:0 "The decision has been made. Austria-Hungary will be turned into a federation, with 6 memberstates: Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, Poland-Ruthenia, Transylvania, and Jugoslavia. Some states will have subdivisions, where the ethnic borders necessitate it, but for the most part, these will be the self-governing regions of the federation. All states will delegate representatives into a common governmental body, which will rule with supervision from the monarch."
 hungary_flavor.102.a:0 "It shall be called the Austro-Hungarian Federation."
 hungary_flavor.102.b:0 "It shall be called the Danubian Federation."
 
 hungary_flavor.103.t:0 "Albania wants to join our faction"
 hungary_flavor.103.d:0 "After the successful partition of Yugoslavia, Albania has approached us with a request to join our faction. Perhaps they mistook our generosity regarding the state of Montenegro, for an act of friendship. At any rate, we have to deal with their request. What is our response?"
 hungary_flavor.103.a:0 "We will accept their request."
 hungary_flavor.103.b:0 "Is it not enough that we gave them Montenegro?"
 
 hungary_flavor.104.t:0 "Germany offers Carpathian Ruthenia"
 hungary_flavor.104.d:0 "Germany has now annexed Bohemia, and the Czechoslovakian state is falling to pieces. They do not have explicit plans of their own for Carpathian Ruthenia, and have offered us a chance to take it, as an act of friendship. We can just ignore the offer, but claiming it might be an important step towards revision of our territory."
 hungary_flavor.104.a:0 "We accept the territory."
 hungary_flavor.104.b:0 "We don't care about borders."
 
 hungary_flavor.105.t:0 "Italian Alliance"
 hungary_flavor.105.d:0 "After the Yugoslavian conference was over, Italian ambassadors have approached our delegation with a proposal. In return for giving in to their claims in Yugoslavia, they are willing to join our alliance, and join forces with us."
 hungary_flavor.105.a:0 "Welcome them to our faction."
 hungary_flavor.105.b:0 "Politely refuse their initiative."
 
 hungary_flavor.106.t:0 "Hungarian-Slovakian Small War"
 hungary_flavor.106.d:0 "Our borders with Slovakia were not strictly defined after the annexation of Carpathian Ruthenia. In an attempt to secure the valley of Ung, our forces have launched an offensive against Slovakia from the west, taking minimal losses. Slovakians withdrew from the region, but shortly launched a counterattack, retaking some of the lost territory. The entire skirmish lasted for a few days, and ended with a couple dozen dead on both sides. Still, we can consider this a success, and put a positive spin on it in propaganda pieces."
 hungary_flavor.106.a:0 "A great success for out nation."
 
 hungary_flavor.107.t:0 "Czechoslovakia allows referendum"
 hungary_flavor.107.d:0 "Czechoslovakia has agreed to the proposed referendum. The people of Southern Slovakia can finally decide, where they want to belong."
 hungary_flavor.107.a:0 "Let us hope for favorable results."
 
 hungary_flavor.108.t:0 "Czechoslovakia disallows referendum"
 hungary_flavor.108.d:0 "Czechoslovakia refused to host the referendum for Southern Slovakia. Relations between our countries have not deteriorated, but this is bound to drive a wedge between us in the future."
 hungary_flavor.108.a:0 "They can't deny our right to it forever."
 hungary_flavor.108.b:0 "Use our influence in the faction to force the referendum."
 
 hungary_flavor.109.t:0 "Yugoslavia enters the Visegrád Group"
 hungary_flavor.109.d:0 "After the formation of the Visegrád Group, it was dubious at first, whether the alliance was strong enough to defend itself, let alone expand its influence. Yugoslavia has just announced its entry into the group, massively strengthening its influence in the region. This means that the Visegrád Group is no longer just a petty pact of nations, but a force to be reckoned with in the playing field of Europe."
 hungary_flavor.109.a:0 "A resounding success for the alliance."
 
 hungary_flavor.110.t:0 "Yugoslavia declines invitation"
 hungary_flavor.110.d:0 "The negotiations with Yugoslavia failed. We did not manage to convince them to join the Visegrád Group, and thus, our influence remains limited in the Balkans."
 hungary_flavor.110.a:0 "They don't know what they are missing."
 
 hungary_flavor.111.t:0 "Yugoslavia agrees to border changes"
 hungary_flavor.111.d:0 "During the settlement negotiations with Yugoslavia, it was agreed upon, that the Hungarian people needed to be kept on Hungarian soil. We managed to settle on which regions shall remain part of Yugoslavia, and which would become part of Hungary again. We have regained important land, with significant Hungarian population."
 hungary_flavor.111.a:0 "And yet, no blood needed to be shed."
 
 hungary_flavor.112.t:0 "Yugoslavia agrees to partial border change"
 hungary_flavor.112.d:0 "The negotiations were frought with arguments for both sides, and eventually, a compromise was reached. Some Hungarian population is to be transferred to Hungarian soil, and the territory of Prekmurje will be given to Hungary. This is not all that we hoped for, but at least the effort was not entirely in vain."
 hungary_flavor.112.a:0 "A fair agreement nonetheless."
 
 hungary_flavor.113.t:0 "Yugoslavia refuses to change borders"
 hungary_flavor.113.d:0 "The Yugoslavian government made it clear, that ceding territory was out of the question. They would not make any concessions, and they will defend the sovereignty of their nation by all means necessary. The negotiations achieved nothing."
 hungary_flavor.113.a:0 "A waste of effort."
 
 hungary_flavor.114.t:0 "Germany offers the rest of Vojvodina"
 hungary_flavor.114.d:0 "We already own Backa, which has the most Hungarians in Vojvodina, but Germany has offered the rest of it, as a sing of goodwill. Will we take their offer?"
 hungary_flavor.114.a:0 "Of course."
 hungary_flavor.114.b:0 "We have no need of those lands."
 
 hungary_flavor.115.t:0 "Meeting in Berlin"
 hungary_flavor.115.d:0 "Hitler has arranged to meet our regent, Miklós Horthy in Berlin, to discuss an important matter. He seeks to divide Czechoslovakia with Hungary, and wanted to know what role Hungary would play in this. If we were to play the role of aggressor, he might even give us the entirety of Slovakia, but we could settle for less if we wanted to."
 hungary_flavor.115.a:0 "We want no part of this."
 hungary_flavor.115.b:0 "We will be content with Carpathian Ruthenia."
 hungary_flavor.115.c:0 "We offer full cooperation, if they give us Slovakia."
 
 hungary_flavor.116.t:0 "Hitler agrees to our request"
 hungary_flavor.116.d:0 "The meeting was concluded, and Horthy has agreed with Hitler on the terms of our involvement in the partition of Czechoslovakia. We should now make preparations to fulfill our end of the bargain."
 hungary_flavor.116.a:0 "A successful meeting."
 
 hungary_flavor.117.t:0 "Inconclusive meeting"
 hungary_flavor.117.d:0 "After much discussion, there was no agreement in what Hungary will get after the partition. Hitler made no promises about our territorial gains."
 hungary_flavor.117.a:0 "We shall still hope for the best of outcomes."
 
 hungary_flavor.118.t:0 "Finland accepts alliance"
 hungary_flavor.118.d:0 "Finland has hastily signed the alliance that we proposed. They now expect us to immediately declare war on the Soviet Union, and help defend their country."
 hungary_flavor.118.a:0 "Together we will beat the commies!"
 
 hungary_flavor.119.t:0 "Finland declines alliance"
 hungary_flavor.119.d:0 "Suprisingly, Finland has rejected our proposal, eliminating the possibility, that our alliance comes to their aid. They are now surely doomed, for they alone can not stop the Soviet Union."
 hungary_flavor.119.a:0 "They will perish without us."
 
 hungary_flavor.120.t:0 "Peace with Britain"
 hungary_flavor.120.d:0 "We have now accomplished everything we set out to do, as our borders have been restored. The United Kingdom thought that they could contain our expansion by declaring war against us, and they have obviously failed. However, a drawn out war could hurt us just as much as it could hurt them, so it may benefit us to seek peace with them. They have bigger things to worry about, and we are content with what we have accomplished."
 hungary_flavor.120.a:0 "Send the peace offer."
 hungary_flavor.120.b:0 "We are not done with this war yet."
 
 hungary_flavor.121.t:0 "Britain accepts"
 hungary_flavor.121.d:0 "The United Kingdom has accepted the peace offer we sent. We returned all territory that was not claimed by us, and singed a peace treaty with them and their allies, officially nullifying the Treaty of Trianon."
 hungary_flavor.121.a:0 "Peace at last."
 
 hungary_flavor.122.t:0 "The war continues"
 hungary_flavor.122.d:0 "The United Kingdom refused our peace terms, so the war goes on as if nothing happened. Seems like we will need to use more conventional means to convince them to stop."
 hungary_flavor.122.a:0 "They will regret not signing the peace now."
 
 hungary_flavor.123.t:0 "Slovakian self-governance"
 hungary_flavor.123.d:0 "We have now acquired all Slovakian lands, and though they belonged to [Root.GetName] originally, there are those who propose the estabilishment of a Slovakian government, that would still answer to us, but would have some degree of independence. We could decide freely, which lands this new Slovakia would get, so we would be free to keep all lands, that are primarily inhabited by Hungarians."
 hungary_flavor.123.a:0 "We will not set up a new government."
 hungary_flavor.123.b:0 "Set up all of Slovakia as a puppet state."
 hungary_flavor.123.c:0 "Set up Northern Slovakia as a puppet state."
 hungary_flavor.123.e:0 "Set up Northern Slovakia as a puppet state, but keep Carpathian Ruthenia." 
 
 hungary_flavor.124.t:0 "Claims on Yugoslavia"
 hungary_flavor.124.d:0 "Now that we have signed the pact of friendship with Yugoslavia, it is time to consider our territorial claims towards them. We could renounce all claims towards them, as a sign of friendship, or we could hold on to our claims on Hungarian-inhabited lands, in hopes of a future settlement with Yugoslavia."
 hungary_flavor.124.a:0 "We will renounce all claims towards Yugoslavia."
 hungary_flavor.124.b:0 "We still want the territories, that have a Hungarian majority."
 hungary_flavor.124.c:0 "We will not be renouncing any claims." 
 
 hungary_flavor.125.t:0 "Claims on Croatia"
 hungary_flavor.125.d:0 "Croatia is now its own state, having been separated from Yugoslavia. While we do still have territorial claims towards them, it might be the smart choice to abandon these claims, and instead seek friendship with Croatia."
 hungary_flavor.125.a:0 "We will renounce all claims towards Croatia."
 hungary_flavor.125.b:0 "We maintain all claims towards Croatia."
 
 hungary_flavor.126.t:0 "A new government"
 hungary_flavor.126.d:0 "We have decided to put an end to the authoritarian rulership of the regent. Hungary shall be governed by a parliment, that is elected by the people. The only question now is, what kind of government should we form. We could maintain a form of the monarchy, giving marginal power to the king (or regent), or we could abandon the idea of a kingdom entirely, and turn the country into a republic."
 hungary_flavor.126.a:0 "A Parlimentary Monarchy shall be estabilished."
 hungary_flavor.126.b:0 "Hungary will become a republic."
 
 hungary_flavor.127.t:0 "Fight for Transylvania"
 hungary_flavor.127.d:0 "Romania has taken sides in the current conflict, and is now at war with the Allies. If we want to, we could offer our help against Romania, in return for a promise, that we will get Transylvania at the end of the war. It is a risky proposal, as the English have not exactly been supportive of our territorial revision, but should they agree, we could end up restoring the entirety of Transylvania to our country."
 hungary_flavor.127.a:0 "Offer our help in return for Transylvania."
 hungary_flavor.127.b:0 "Try to stay neutral as long as possible."
 
 hungary_flavor.128.t:0 "United Kingdom refuses help"
 hungary_flavor.128.d:0 "Our proposal was met with resistance from the United Kingdom. They do not want our help, if it comes at the cost of giving us Transylvania."
 hungary_flavor.128.a:0 "We both could have benefited from this."
 
 hungary_flavor.129.t:0 "Austria joins the Visegrád Group"
 hungary_flavor.129.d:0 "The Visegrád Group has a new member: Austria. All treaties have been signed, and Austria is now a full member of the faction."
 hungary_flavor.129.a:0 "Let us welcome them."
 
 hungary_flavor.130.t:0 "Austria truns down alliance offer"
 hungary_flavor.130.d:0 "Austria has refused the helping hand we reached towards them. They do not wish to be part of the Visegrád Group. They will no doubt be swallowed up in the international chaos soon, if they do not align themselves with one faction or the other."
 hungary_flavor.130.a:0 "A real shame."
 
 hungary_flavor.131.t:0 "Romania agrees to cede Southern Dobrudja"
 hungary_flavor.131.d:0 "Although we hoped to accomplish more, we only managed to secure the southern parts of dobrudja for Bulgaria in the negotiations with Romania. We will get the rest eventually, even if we have to pry it from Romania with war."
 hungary_flavor.131.a:0 "We have to be content with this for now."
 
 hungary_flavor.132.t:0 "Romania agrees to cede all of Dobrudja"
 hungary_flavor.132.d:0 "Romania has finally agreed to our demands. Bulgaria is now the owner of all of Dobrudja, greatly decreasing the amount of ethnic Bulgarians, who live in Romania."
 hungary_flavor.132.a:0 "And nobody needed to get hurt."
 
 hungary_flavor.133.t:0 "Romania refuses Bulgarian territorial demands"
 hungary_flavor.133.d:0 "Romania has had the wherewithal to outright refuse our demands for Dobrudja. They do not wish to give an inch of ground to Bulgaria. We will have to convince them otherwise with weapons, no doubt."
 hungary_flavor.133.a:0 "They will live to regret this decision."
 
 hungary_flavor.134.t:0 "Greece accepts alliance proposal"
 hungary_flavor.134.d:0 "Greece has accepted our generous offer of alliance. [ROOT.GetFactionName] is now one member stronger, and the southern reaches of the Balkans are under our influence."
 hungary_flavor.134.a:0 "We grow stronger."
 
 hungary_flavor.135.t:0 "Greece declines alliance proposal"
 hungary_flavor.135.d:0 "The weak nation of Greece has decided they wish to stand alone in the storm that is coming. They declined our invitation into [ROOT.GetFactionName]."
 hungary_flavor.135.a:0 "They will soon perish without us."
 
 hungary_flavor.136.t:0 "Military land survey"
 hungary_flavor.136.d:0 "As per the order of [Root.GetLeader], the [Root.GetAdjective] military has conducted a nation-wide land survey, producing detailed maps for the military leadership. The maps provide detailed information about roads, buildings, geographical features, rivers and lakes, along with any other topographical features that are important to the military."
 hungary_flavor.136.a:0 "Ok."
 
 hungary_flavor.137.t:0 "Germany seeks access through Hungarian lands to Poland"
 hungary_flavor.137.d:0 "Germany is at war with Poland, and they seek to open up a new front in the conflict, by attacking Poland through our lands. We could refuse, but perhaps it would be best to side with the victors here, and just let the German troops pass."
 hungary_flavor.137.a:0 "Let them through."
 hungary_flavor.137.b:0 "We won't betray our Polish friends."
 
 hungary_flavor.138.t:0 "Polish refugees"
 hungary_flavor.138.d:0 "Poland is losing ground against the Germans every day, and the war looks to be decided already. Some Polish troops can no longer retreat through other states to neutral territory, so they asked to pass our borders instead, to join their allies elsewhere. Allowing them through would certainly anger the Germans, but it would be an honorable act in helping our Polish friends."
 hungary_flavor.138.a:0 "Let them in."
 hungary_flavor.138.b:0 "We will not risk the wrath the Germans."
 
 hungary_flavor.139.t:0 "The Zaolzie question"
 hungary_flavor.139.d:0 "Some of our advisors have suggested that we negotiate the transfer of Zaolzie to Poland. Seeing as they are our allies, and the territory in question is under our influence, it would certainly make sense to do so, as there is a significant Polish minority in the area."
 hungary_flavor.139.a:0 "Zaolzie belongs to Poland."
 hungary_flavor.139.b:0 "Things are fine just the way they are."
 
 hungary_flavor.140.t:0 "Germany agrees to Burgenland deal"
 hungary_flavor.140.d:0 "Our offer was welcomed by the German government. We will send them much needed reinforcements, in return for the territory of Burgenland."
 hungary_flavor.140.a:0 "Great news."
